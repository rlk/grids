# Inline Chord Grid Generator

This Javascript library seeks DOM elements with class "gridgen" and interprets the inner text of each element as a chord calculation expression. A simple set of chord operations enable the complex manipulation of guitar chords and the generation of sequences of [Ted Greene style chord grids](https://www.tedgreene.com/teaching/chords.asp).
