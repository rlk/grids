# Inline Chord Grid Generator

This small Javascript library seeks DOM elements with class "gridgen" and converts them to [Ted Greene style chord grids](https://www.tedgreene.com/teaching/chords.asp). It parses the inner text of each element and interprets it as elements on a guitar fretboard. A simple set of chord operations enable the complex manipulation of guitar chords and the generation of sequences of chord grids.
